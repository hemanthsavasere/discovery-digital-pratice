Determine all positive integer values that evenly divide into a number, its factors. 
Return the pth element of your list, sorted ascending. If there is no pth element, return 0.

 

For example, given the number n = 20, its factors are {1,2,4,5,10,20}. Using 1-based indexing if p = 3, return 4. If p > 6, return 0.

 
Function Description 

Complete the function pthFactor in the editor below. The function should return a long integer value of the pth integer factor of n.

 
pthFactor has the following parameter(s):

    n:  an integer
    p:  an integer

 

Constraints

    1 ≤ n ≤ 1015
    1 ≤ p ≤ 109

 
Input Format for Custom Testing

Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

 

The first line contains an integer n, the number to factor.

The second line contains an integer p, the 1-based index of the factor to return.

 
Sample Case 0

Sample Input 0

10
3

Sample Output 0

5

Explanation 0

Factoring n = 10 we get {1, 2, 5, 10}. We then return the p = 3rd factor as our answer.
Sample Case 1

Sample Input 1

10
5

Sample Output 1

0

Explanation 1

Factoring n = 10 we get {1, 2, 5, 10}. There are only 4 factors and p = 5. We return 0 as our answer.
